create a new project: npx tsdx create newlib
then delete newlib/node_modules
then in root run npm install

don't install any other project, just import it.

for changes to a project to appear in one which depends on it, rebuild the project then restart the extension host
similarly for npm installs to affect auto error checking, restart the extension host

rebuilding a package while React running will break with compilation error, needs to restart
